While you aren't going to be able to set the health bar to be exactly 3.14 pixels outside of the unit frames, you can change options you actually care about such as bar height, ordering, frame height and so on. To speed up configuration, you can configure multiple units at the same time through the global configuration. For example, if you want to set the height of the Player, Target, Focus and Party frames to 50 then the height of Target's Target, Target's Target of Target, Focus Target to 30 you can easily do this by changing two options instead of having to do it seven times.",

This means if a spell is on cooldown and you push the button it will continue to the next item in the list with each press until it reaches the end and starts over.

I change the artwork in the talent frame. I've used a mixture of artworks from Blizzard's concept art, Blizzard class website page, and the Artifact trait backgrounds. Why? Well, this addon actually has a little bit of history. It's one of the first addons I actually worked on, and originally it was for the purpose of placing the old artworks back into the talent frame. Before the Dragonflight talent rework, they didn't have a background image. The talents were boring to look at. For the most part, it was nostalgia. The current ones are great, and now they're just the default option that's selectable as a new option in a dropdown menu in the Interface Addons pane under TalentArt.",

So that his baby would go forward without his assistance he placed the addon under Creative Commons license to enable others to carry on maintaining it.  I was one of the people he asked if I wanted to be one of the developers going forward.  At the time I wasn't playing the game at all due to funds but as per usual, expansion came along and it was time to get my characters up to speed, as well as my addons.  So I monitored the CurseForge page and found disappointing customers, I then emailed Scott and had no reply.  I decided I would take up the baton and try and keep it at least running with as few problems as possible, my skills are not on par with Scott so it may take me longer to identify some errors than it would for him.",

The system combines elements of D\u0026D 5e with a Warcraft twist, and was used in another addon, Dicemaster, which the guild used since early BFA. Where Dicemaster offers a greater degree of flexibility in terms of the event systems that can be created with it, RPToolkit instead offers an out-of-the-box event solution that is familiar to many RPers. Put simply: if you\ufffdre looking for an addon that you can create your own dice-based event system in, RPT is probably not for you right now - but it may be in the near future! If you\ufffdre looking for an event system that is tried, tested and has been carefully balanced over more than five years, then RPT is definitely for you.",

If you're like me, when a raid leader does a ready check, you go through a mental checklist as you look over your buffs and gear, to make sure that you really are ready. Did I remember to do my own buff, do I have all pally blessings, do I have the correct pet out, am I still flasked/elixired, is my durability okay, did I forget to take off my riding crop, etc, etc. This is what BuffEnough does for you. It scans the raid to figure out what you should have, and then scans your buffs and gear to figure out what you do have. If the box is green, the answer is 'yes', you're buff enough. If the box is red or yellow, then you're still missing something and hovering your mouse over the box will tell you what it is in the tooltip.",
