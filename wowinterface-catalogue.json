   "This addon, 99 bottles of beer, outputs the song \"99 Bottles of Beer\" via SendChatMessage, to specified channel (GUILD by default). It is intended primarily for role playing, song singing around bonfires, or when waiting a long time in pug queues for a replacement tank/healer, or any time you are bored. You can change the number of drinks, what you are drinking, and more. A neat feature of this addon is that while it does the counting it uses the text version of the numbers, up to 1,599,555 instead of the numbers itself. Another nice thing is you can set the number of drinks, the time between them, and where they are served. The addon also allows you to stop and start the song whenever you like. the commands line is /bob cmd arg",

As new issues and workarounds are discovered they will be added.  As old issues get fixed they will be removed.  Users benefit by having a single addon they can just keep updated to get the fixes.  Blizzard benefits by having a single addon to look for our workarounds to their problems and hopefully things get fixed sooner.",

Combined with FuBar2Broker, ButtonBin can fully replace FuBar as a displayer. With the new default configuration a left, right and center top bar layout is used, allowing for an easier transition.",

   "FlightMap is all about the flights you take in the World of Warcraft. It draws lines on the continent maps, showing you visually where you can fly from each zone as you mouse over them, as well as showing a window listing all the available destinations, their costs and their flight durations. On the zone level map, flight masters appear as small boot icons, allowing you to see where they are. During flights, a castbar-alike progress bar will show you how long is left on your current journey.",

The addon does not track like a tracking ability does, rather it \"remembers\" where you have found various items in the past. It does this whenever you gather (perform herbalism, mining or opening) on an item, and records the specific map location in its history. This addon is made for World of Warcraft:Classic",

After doing that, I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to improve other parts of the addon.  I am not a programmer by any means, and there are likely to be some features that don't function either due to the new patch or my incompetence in programming them.  I don't take any credit for Dagma's original work, and he did an amazing job writing this addon.  However, the original addon has not been updated since 11/2010.",

The GrimUI core itself controls your unit frames, artwork, some action buttons and a whole lot more! Best of all, it does this with out you spending hours on placing frames.  It looks and functions much like MazzleUI did, it is also similar to nUI if you are familiar with that.  GrimUI out of the box should require no setup itself.  Macaroon handles the main action buttons and is included.  GrimUI will setup a default Macaroon layout. Check out GrimUI on Facebook GrimUI Fan Page ",

   "ieoFontMagic is just a little amazing addon that doesn't mess with your UI too much, though makes it a lot easier to read. Personally i came to conclusion that using default font for WoW is a bad thing to do with high UIScale (0.64). IMO the best font for that high UIScale is Prototype. But then blizzard scrolling combat text picks it up also and IMO it just looks huge and clunky as damage font. So i came to solution by making this little amazing add-on that just changes damage font and that of the scrolling combat text (like \"Entering combat\" and such). You can pretty much just check the screen shot =)).",

   "I made this as a continuation upon DerangementMinimapBlips, but to my own preference. It shrinks down friendly NPC/Player targets for minimap icons on purpose because I find them to be a much lower priority. This distinguishes them from enemy targets better, allowing you to more easily sift through many enemies that may be clustered in an area. This is especially useful for hunters, where Track Humanoids in particular can make the minimap so cluttered that you might as well otherwise disable it. Because it's a texture replacement addon, it should be compatible with every other addon with exception to another texture replacement addon like aforementioned DerangementMinimapBlips. Like the previous addon, it also makes gathering nodes into a silver colour to distinguish from neutral players/NPCs. Unlike the previous addon, I've actually switched the icon for player / NPCs so that player icons have a gold ring around them. I felt this gives a better indication that player characters are unique.",

So after looking for some time with out much luck I stumbled across FastDisenchant by masahikotao. This seemed to do the trick, but it only dealt with disenchanting and prospecting. I decided that wasn't good enough and put my limited coding knowledge to work with my friend to make it work with other professions. Thus looter was born. Though I admit while messing around with the code we came up with several other features we think would be great to add if we can figure out how.  Its if far from being a final product, but we figured we would get an alpha release version out to start things off.",

This addon includes two helpers that can mitigate some of the effects. These are not subtle, the addon uses the sledgehammer approach to problem solving. The intention is to have you quickly enable one of the helpers when you're in an area of the game with effects that trigger migraines (like the \"Cloak of Ve'nari\" effect in the Maw), and then disable them afterwards. The addon also provides access to some config options that can be helpful which are not exposed in the default Blizzard settings dialog.",

We often found ourselves typing random characters to test chat lag, as well as casting spells to test cast lag.

   "Ouch is a mod to help review the recent damage and/or healing taken by a player, group member, or raid member. It's designed to be opened and reviewed after the fact to help determine why a player has died, or is taking too much damage, etc. It's like a personal combat log for each person you set it to, up to a max of 8. This is a very handy tool for raid leaders, or healing coordinators in a raid to troubleshoot tank deaths!",

While in a Party or RAID Pally Power can be used to assign blessings to other Paladins. Fellow Paladins will also have to run Pally Power for this to occur and the Paladin doing the assignments will have to be the Party Leader, Raid Leader or Raid Assistant. Fellow Paladins can select the \"Free Assignment\" setting to allow other non-leaders to change your Blessing assignment.

I got to thinking, I have 9 other toons, I wonder which ones already knew the Macaw.  When I got back to town I mailed it to my first alt.  When he opened his mail it said he already knew the [Green Wing Macaw].  Now I had to mail to to my next alt.  My 5th toon wound up being the one needing the Macaw.  What a pain in the butt.  I went to all the major addon sites and started looking for an addon that could show me what Companions my toons knew.  After several hours I turned up nothing.

In the raid finder interface, you will select your roles(tank,dps,healer), save your gear rating profiles for those roles, choose optimal or quick group matching, and then, depending on your gear rating profiles, you will be able to select Raids for which to queue. While queued the different addons of the players within the queue will communicate with each other until full raids can be found. The players will receive a message that their raid is ready, and when everyone marks themselves as ready, raid invites will go out, and bang, full raid, no drama, hassle, no effort what-so-ever. Basically the exact same thing as Blizzard's Dungeon Finder, except not cross-server and for Raids. A better way to pug raids. It makes it so the player wants to pug a raid, they will now have a choice outside of sitting in a capital, watching Trade, waiting for a raid to start, or going through the whole painful hassle of trying organize one himself.",

   "SUF focuses on a simple configuration while maintaining the flexibility that most users will care about, preventing unnecessary bloating of the addon that sacrifices performance. While you aren't going to be able to set the health bar to be exactly 3.14 pixels outside of the unit frames, you can change options you actually care about such as bar height, ordering, frame height and so on. To speed up configuration, you can configure multiple units at the same time through the global configuration. For example, if you want to set the height of the Player, Target, Focus and Party frames to 50 then the height of Target's Target, Target's Target of Target, Focus Target to 30 you can easily do this by changing two options instead of having to do it seven times.",

   "World of Warcraft has always had two main ways of navigation. A small, short range, top-down Minimap, and a large, long range, top-down World Map. The trouble with both of these, is they force you to either look away from, or mostly block your view of the game world. Other games have sought to address this by putting important destinations on a \"tape\" compass. This not only allows you the ease of simply pointing your character towards the destination, but takes up significantly less space on the UI. ",

I change the artwork in the talent frame. I've used a mixture of artworks from Blizzard's concept art, Blizzard class website page, and the Artifact trait backgrounds. Why? Well, this addon actually has a little bit of history. It's one of the first addons I actually worked on, and originally it was for the purpose of placing the old artworks back into the talent frame. Before the Dragonflight talent rework, they didn't have a background image. The talents were boring to look at. For the most part, it was nostalgia. The current ones are great, and now they're just the default option that's selectable as a new option in a dropdown menu in the Interface Addons pane under TalentArt.",

However, the only way to know that, without this AddOn, is to memorize what powers they pick up from the chat window or by asking them. Instead, TorghastTeams provides a simple-to-understand interface that lets anyone see what powers their party members have, just like the default frames, plus some more!",

   "Hey guys, xylotism here. This is my first UI, I hope you like it! It's designed with 2560x1440 resolution in mind but seems to work fine at 1920x1080 too. It should work for any class and spec, for any content - although you may want additional addons for specific goals, feel free to mix and match to your preference. My goal with this UI is to have plenty of utility tied to a very small visual footprint. You should only be able to see what you need to see at any given time, with everything else tucked away so you can experience the game itself rather than a bunch of bars and windows.",

There's a few Zookeeper data bugs of note for mounts as well -- the data incorrectly flags the Sandstone Drake as requiring 525 alchemy, and makes the Red Qiraji Battle Tank entirely unsummonable.
